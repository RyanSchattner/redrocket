Uses Alpaca API to scan all stocks on AMEX and NASDAQ to predict what might gap using Keras/Tensorflow. Deployment ready for Heroku.
Comes with multiple hp5 and PKL files to try different setups to see what works best. 
**Would not use with real money due to current alpaca data quality and better management of purchase prices on low float stocks that may have wide bid/ask spreads.
